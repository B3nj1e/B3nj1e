### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for clicking! My name is Ben and I am a full stack web developer with a special interest in UI/UX. 

I have a background in Health, and have been working as a Podiatrist for the last 4 years. I am currently undertaking the [University of Adelaide full stack web development bootcamp](https://bootcamps.adelaide.edu.au/). Feel free to view my current [Portfolio](https://b3nj1e.github.io/02-Homework-Portfolio-Clewer/?fbclid=IwAR1XvfMArOfluaroruyR284XPa_D58UiLPKy8Mq56nW1gGms785gNMdo9Ww) with the latest projects I've worked on.
